# l4s-for-ns3
Implementation of L4S protocols (TCP Prague CCA and DualPI2 AQM) for the ns-3 simulator.

In this repository we provide patches to add L4S-related codes for ns-3, including:
- Accurate ECN to the ns-3 TCP infrastructure
- TCP Prague as a TCP congestion control option
- A DualPI2 AQM as a traffic-control qdisc option (currently WIP)
